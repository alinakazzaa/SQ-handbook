# Handbook for Best Practices

## Sample Survey Component

This handbook is a reference guide to demonstrate the approach to project management within the organization. Here you will find process guidelines for planning, such as:

* Sprint task estimation
* Description of tasks
* Task prioritization using the MoSCoW (Must, Should, Could, Won't) technique
* Identify the users of the software i.e. surveyor and surveyed and the functionality each of them have

### Scrum sprint backlog and task estimation

The software component will consist of functionality to create a survey and receive answers to this survey. Therefore, the ‘surveyor’ and the ‘surveyed’ roles will be associated with the specific tasks. 

Tasks will be done in 'sprints' or development stages, which will be timed and each task will receive an estimation of completion time. 

Note: development time of this sample software will be much shorter than real life tools, however it will help to describe the process of the Scrum backlog, which will be customized to each product.
